## Adventure Works Data Analytics Project

This README provides an overview of the Adventure Works data analytics project, which focuses on analyzing various business aspects of Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional company created by Microsoft. The project aims to utilize data analytics tools to derive insights from the company's sales, production, and inventory data.

### Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns. The project also aims to compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
  - **SQL Server**: For data extraction and manipulation.
  - **Alteryx**: For data preparation and analysis.
  - **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning and preliminary analysis.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   - Gathered data from multiple sources including sales transactions, customer interactions, and product records.
   - Cleaned the datasets using SQL and Excel to ensure accuracy and reliability.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for deeper insights.
   - Developed a calendar table to facilitate time-based analysis.

3. **Data Modeling**
   - Established relationships between various tables (fact tables and dimension tables) to create a comprehensive data model.
   - Utilized Power Query for transforming and loading the data into Power BI.

4. **Interactive Reporting**
   - Designed an interactive report in Power BI that includes various visualization tools such as charts, slicers, maps, and matrices.
   - The report allows users to filter data at different levels (visual-level, page-level, report-level).
